# Vitamin D

A game made using [Quil](http://quil.info/) for the [Spring 2016 Lisp Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/spring-2016-lisp-game-jam).

## The game

You only have so much time to spend on different things.

But *where* will you spend it?

Go outside to fill up your Vitamin D which influences your mood.

Stay inside to be productive, make money and be successful.


## Running it

You need to have Java installed to run the game.

There is a compiled `.jar` in the `/target` folder.
Either double-click it or run `java -jar $jarname` from your terminal.

## Icons
